# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Standards

### SKILL.md Files
- Use bullet points (`-`) instead of numbered lists for Instructions section
- This makes it easier to add/remove items without renumbering
- Keep descriptions clear and skill-appropriate
- Include Usage examples with code blocks

### plan.md Files
- Use bullet points (`-`) for all lists
- Avoid numbered lists to facilitate easier maintenance
- Structure sections clearly with headings
- Include implementation details and technical considerations

## Commit Message Standards
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Common types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore
- Avoid unnecessary sections like "Files Added", "Files Modified", "Generated with"
